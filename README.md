- 👋 Hi, I’m @A-leh
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and development, love a good cup of coffee and watching documentaries.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science and its curiosities, especially HTML, CSS and other languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on to be someone better and explore the world, not by infringing my ideas and beliefs but by trying new things.
- 📫 You can find me Here, at discord or on my personal blog. And also in my e-mail.
